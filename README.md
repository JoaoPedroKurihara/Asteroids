# Asteroids
Short game submitted as an assignment on the 19th of October, 2021

In this mockup of the original Asteroids videogame, the player controls the triangular shaped ship using W/S to move the ship forwards/backwards and A/D to turn left and right respectively, and Spacebar to fire. The player must shoot the asteroids and hostile UFOs which spawn during regular intervals, starting with a longer grace period after clicking play. Shooting either asteroids or UFOs will destroy and despawn the game object. The player has three hitpoints and an invulnerability period after taking damage, and starts with ten bullets, which must be replenished by collecting the capsule objects which also spawn during intervals. Upon colliding with asteroids or being shot thrice, the player will "die" and be respawned immediately at the center of the screen, able to continue playing. There is no score tracking in this game.
